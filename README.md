# LSB-Image-Steganography
This project implements Least Significant Bit (LSB) Image Steganographyâ€”a technique for hiding information within an image by altering its pixel data in an imperceptible way. Using this method, users can encode text within an image file so that the hidden message is undetectable to the naked eye.
